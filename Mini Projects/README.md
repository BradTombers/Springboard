# Springboard Mini Projects

### 1) Exploratory Data Analysis on Human Body Temperature
In this project, I use the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance to analyze a dataset of human body temperatures.
### 2) Exploratory Data Analysis on Racial Discrimination
This project requires the use of statistical analysis to determine whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.
### 3) Exploratory Data Analysis on Hospital Readmissions
In this project, I make recommendations for reducing the readmission rate of hospitals.
### 4) Linear Regression - Predicting Boston Housing Prices
Here I use linear regression to identify the features that impact the housing prices of towns near Boston.
### 5) Logistic Regression - Predicting Gender from Height and Weight Data
In this project, I use logistic regression to predict gender from height and weight data.
### 6) Text Classification of Movie Ratings with Naive Bayes
